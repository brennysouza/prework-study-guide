        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language"</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of the website (think of it as the framing of house)</li>
          <li>As an HTML dev, you are responsible for providing structure and a positive user experience</li>
          <li>Some HTML elements include:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Head element: a container for meta data</li>
              <li>Meta element: contains info about the page that is used by the browser</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS makes a website visually appealing</li>
          <li>CSS = cascading style sheets</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS</li>
            <ul>
              <li>inline CSS</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Developers use inline CSS when they want to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
                  <li>Apply to specific HTML tags</li>
                  <li>Useful for quick and permanent changes</li>
                  <li>Less flexible</li>
                </ul>
              <li>internal CSS style sheet</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>This contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
                  <li>The rules only apply to the page inwhich this element is applied. You can configure CSS classes and IDs.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>external CSS style sheet</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>This is the most common way to style of a webpage</li>
                  <li>Preferred because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes dseign changes easier</li>
                  <li>When using external CSS, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
            <li>There are two parts to a CSS element</li>
              <ul>
                <li>A selector</li>
                <li>A decleration block</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A decleration contains two important components:</li>
                    <li>The CSS property we want to apply</li>
                    <li>The value of that property</li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
            <li>* selector = the asterisk applies rule to all elements on the page</li>
            <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself Code: Combining two selectors into a single CSS rule</li>
            <li>A CSS selector will always have a period before it [i.e. ". card"]</li>
            <li>There are two ways to assign colors in CSS</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Semantic Refernces [i.e. gray, blue, etc]</li>
                <li>Hexidecimal code aka Hex #</li>
