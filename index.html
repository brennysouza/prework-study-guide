        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language"</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of the website (think of it as the framing of house)</li>
          <li>As an HTML dev, you are responsible for providing structure and a positive user experience</li>
          <li>Some HTML elements include:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Head element: a container for meta data</li>
              <li>Meta element: contains info about the page that is used by the browser</li>
              <li>Charset (character set) element: sets our character encoding</li>
              <li>HTTP Equivalent: sets and HTTP header for content</li>
              <li>Viewpoint element: sets the default view of our webpage</li>
            </ul>
          <li>There exists the concept of "parent" and "child" elements</li>
          <li>Here are a few sections included in the HTML boiler plate</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS makes a website visually appealing</li>
          <li>CSS = cascading style sheets</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS</li>
            <ul>
              <li>inline CSS</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Developers use inline CSS when they want to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
                  <li>Apply to specific HTML tags</li>
                  <li>Useful for quick and permanent changes</li>
                  <li>Less flexible</li>
                </ul>
              <li>internal CSS style sheet</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>This contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
                  <li>The rules only apply to the page inwhich this element is applied. You can configure CSS classes and IDs.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>external CSS style sheet</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>This is the most common way to style of a webpage</li>
                  <li>Preferred because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes dseign changes easier</li>
                  <li>When using external CSS, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
            <li>There are two parts to a CSS element</li>
              <ul>
                <li>A selector</li>
                <li>A decleration block</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A decleration contains two important components:</li>
                    <li>The CSS property we want to apply</li>
                    <li>The value of that property</li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
            <li>* selector = the asterisk applies rule to all elements on the page</li>
            <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself Code: Combining two selectors into a single CSS rule</li>
            <li>A CSS selector will always have a period before it [i.e. ". card"]</li>
            <li>There are two ways to assign colors in CSS</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Semantic Refernces [i.e. gray, blue, etc]</li>
                <li>Hexidecimal code aka Hex #</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Repository: aka "repo," is a folder located in GitHub for a project</li>
          <li>Branch: a workspace to make changes that dont affect the live site</li>
          <li>Markdown: file formatting</li>

              <li>Can be considered a basic form of writing and formatting for your prose and code. Can be done on GitHub. ("basic writing and formatting syntax," docs.github.com)</li>

              <li>Develop Branch</li>

          <li>Why create these branches? To create a space to work without affecting the branch that is default</li>
          <li>Pull request: ask collaborators for feedback on changes</li>
          <li>git add -A: command that adds modifications in th current working branch to the staging area. The -A flag indicates we want to add all changes</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JS is an object oriented programming language</li>
          <li>JavsScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it more interactive</li>
          <li>Anything from clicking a button, retrieve a button, or fill out a form</li>
          <li>Basic javascript features include: variables, strings, and data types</li>
          <li>Control flow: the order in which a computer executes code in a javacript file</li>
          <li>Using control flow, I can add conditional logic to this project</li>
          <li>Javascript was invented by Brendan Eich</li>
          <li>API's: Application Programming Interfaces</li>
          <li>As JavaScript skills grow, my websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity</li>
          <li>Variables: containers that store values</li>
          <li>Some consider it a good habit to terminate each statement with a semicolon</li>
          <li>Shouldn't put a semicolon after a closing curly bracket</li>
          <li>Comments: snippets of text [i.e. /*...*/]</li>
          <li>Operators: a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values</li>
          <li>Conditionals: code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not</li>
          <li>Functions: packaging functionality that you wish to reuse</li>
          <li>i.e. of a JavaScript variable: [var shape = "circle";]</li>
            <ul>
              <li>"shape" is the name of container or variable</li>
              <li>stored data is circle</li>
            </ul>
          <li>console.log</li>
            <ul>
              <li>console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code</li>
              <li>.log() is a method which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer</li>
            </ul>
          <li>console.log was created to make it easier for developers to test & debug code</li>
          <li>Control flow: the order in which a computer executes code in a script or file</li>
          <li>Remember that the order of code affects the outcome</li>
            <ul>
              <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, be intentional!</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Truthy: when a condition is true, it will do whatever action is asked to do in between the curly brackets</li>
          <li>Falsy: a value such as: 0,-0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN</li>
          <li>Array: a single variable that is used to hold a group of data typically related</li>
            <ul>
              <li>i.e. var shape = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
            </ul>
          <li>An array can contain a string, a number, and a Boolean value</li>
            <ul>
              <li>i.e. var studentInfo = ["lu", 54, true];</li>
            </ul>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>For loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>Loops are an efficient way to log numerous items are by using loops</li>
            <ul>
              <li>for loops: telling computer to go through each of the shapes in array and log them to console until no shapes left</li>
              <li>for loop contains three statements</li>
              <li>First statment: starting point is a variable of x [i.e. var x = 0]</li>
              <li>Second statement: a condition [i.e. x < shapes.length;]</li>
              <li>Final statement: x+1 or x++, every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>
            </ul> 
          <li>A function: a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
        </ul>
