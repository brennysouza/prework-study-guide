# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for this project was to be able to construct a center point for all the information retained from these assignments as I prepare to begin my coding bootcamp.
- I built this project because I wanted to develop a very basic understanding of some of the common topics that will be taught in this bootcamp. The prework study guide will help organize all my notes.
- This study guide solves the problem of not having any notes to present or study from when needed. Once again, this project becomes the single source for all info retained and learned through out these modules. 
- I learned that the process of developing projects with code is complex, yet something I enjoy and look forward to. Prior to this module, I have had very little experience with HTML and CSS; however, I enjoyed learning more about JavaScript and Github/Git commans as well. I am eager for the future and excited to continue building more.
